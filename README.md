Optical-electrical MATLAB model for simulating PEC photoanode, PV-PEC, &amp; PV-E J-V curves developed by Brian Tam <br>
## Set-up
Run generatePECPVJV for dual PV cells back-to-back or side-to-side with the PEC <br>
Run generatePECPVtandemJV for tandem PV cells back-to-back or side-to-side with the PEC
